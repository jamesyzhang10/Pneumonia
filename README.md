# Pneumonia
This Github Repository contains the code for a Convolutional Neural Network that can accurately identify chest X-ray scans with pneumonia versus without about 95% of the time. I got my dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. I used Tensorflow and Google Colab.
